I'm currently a PhD student fortunate to be advised by [Jackie Chi Kit Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/){:target="\_blank"}.

I'm interested in systematic natural language understanding, especially that which incorporates commonsense reasoning. _More simply, can we get a computer to understand human language?_
