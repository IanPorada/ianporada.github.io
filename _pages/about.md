I'm currently a PhD student fortunate to be advised by [Jackie Chi Kit Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/){:target="\_blank"} and colleagues at [Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/mila/team/){:target="_blank"}.

I'm interested in [systematic](https://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-zenon-pylyshyn/proseminars/Proseminar13/ConnectionistArchitecture.pdf){:target="_blank"} natural language understanding, especially that which incorporates common sense.
