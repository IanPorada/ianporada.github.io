I'm currently a PhD student fortunate to be advised by [Jackie Chi Kit Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/){:target="\_blank"} and colleagues at [Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/mila/team/).

I'm interested in systematic natural language understanding, especially that which incorporates commonsense reasoning.
_More simply, can we get a computer to understand human language?_

To that end, I study computational models of language and their fundamental limitations---primarily their inability to model _semantic plausibility._
This problem is often studied as _selectional preference_ in lexical semantics and _Winograd schemas_ in NLP.
