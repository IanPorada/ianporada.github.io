I'm currently a PhD student in [computer science](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/){:target="_blank"} fortunate to be advised by [Jackie Chi Kit Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/){:target="\_blank"} and colleagues at [Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/mila/team/){:target="_blank"}.

I'm interested in [systematic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010027788900315){:target="_blank"} natural language understanding, especially that which incorporates [common sense](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/1624775.1624816).
_More simply, what would it take for a computer to understand human language?_

This question is [probably vacuous](https://academic.oup.com/mind/article/LIX/236/433/986238){:target="_blank"}, so my research focuses specifically on [semantic plausibility](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21585487/){:target="_blank"}. 
Consider how _"an ant has a kidney"_ is easily interpretable, while _"a kidney has an ant"_ [is not](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/aspects-theory-syntax){:target="_blank"}.
